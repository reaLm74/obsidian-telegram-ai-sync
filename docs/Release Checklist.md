# Release Checklist (New Features Release)

Checklist for releasing a new plugin version using the Release Please + develop/main workflow.

---

## Before Release

- [ ] **Update `release-notes.mjs`** — add new features description to `newFeatures` (shown in plugin on update)
- [ ] **Verify commits** — all changes committed with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
  - `feat:` — new functionality (minor bump)
  - `fix:` — bug fix (patch bump)
  - `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` — breaking changes (major bump)
  - `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:` — no version bump
- [ ] **Local check** — `npm run build` passes without errors

---

## Release Steps

### 1. Commit and push to develop

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: brief feature description"
git push origin develop
```

### 2. Open PR develop → main

- In GitHub: New Pull Request: `develop` → `main`
- **Release Please** will automatically create a PR with version update (CHANGELOG + package.json)

### 3. Merge Release Please PR

- PR titled: `chore: update version of package to X.Y.Z`
- Merges into `develop` branch
- After merge, workflow updates `manifest.json` and `versions.json`

### 4. Merge PR main → develop (if exists)

- PR titled: `Merge main into develop` — branch sync
- Merge into `develop`

### 5. Merge develop → main

- Merge the main PR `develop` → `main`
- **Release workflow** will automatically:
  - build the plugin
  - create GitHub Release with artifacts (main.js, manifest.json, styles.css)

### 6. Sync main → develop

- Workflow creates PR `Merge main into develop`
- Merge to sync branches for the next cycle

## PR Order (when multiple are open)

| # | PR | Action |
|---|-----|--------|
| 1 | Release Please (`chore: update version...`) | Merge into develop |
| 2 | Merge main into develop | Merge into develop |
| 3 | develop → main | Merge into main (triggers release) |

## Commit Message Examples

```
feat: add multi-provider AI support (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
feat: add custom prompts per content type
feat: add local PDF and DOCX extraction
fix: retry on AI API 429 errors
docs: update installation guide
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Release Please didn't create PR** — ensure PR develop→main is opened by repository owner (OWNER)
- **release-notes-check fails** — package.json version must match manifest.json (updated by workflow)
- **Merge conflicts** — resolve manually, preserve CHANGELOG and package.json changes
